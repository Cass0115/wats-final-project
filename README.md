# Final Project

For my final project I would like to do a site for a friend of mine. She is a barre instructor at my gym, and is starting a health and fitness business. She wants a website that she is able to edit, with meal recipes and information on her boot camp classes. This is why I thought that Wordpress would be a good web app to use, since it is easy to use and very editable.
