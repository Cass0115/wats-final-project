# Final Project

For my final project I would like to do a site for a friend of mine. She is a barre instructor at my gym, and is starting a health and fitness business. She wants a website that she is able to edit, with meal recipes and information on her boot camp classes. This is why I thought that Wordpress would be a good web app to use, since it is easy to use and very editable. 

The end site will only be about 5 or so pages. There will be a form for people to be able to leave their information, so she can get in touch with them. For this I plan to use the jquery validation library. I might try to use bootstrap for the mobile version, or try to take it a step further and use the media queries to code for desktop, tablet and phone.
